This is a set of simple demo applications for
[RSyntaxTextArea](https://github.com/bobbylight/RSyntaxTextArea).

## Demos

### RSyntaxTextAreaDemoApp
This is a simple demo application that shows off the syntax highlighting
and code folding capabilities for several languages.
It also allows you to toggle between the baked-in editor themes
as well as several other basic options.

### FindAndReplaceDemo
A _very_ basic demo of the built-in search/replace functionality.
If you want Find and Replace dialogs for free that integrate
with RSTA, check out the
[RSTAUI](https://github.com/bobbylight/RSTAUI) sister project.

### SyntaxSchemeDemo
Shows how to modify the fonts and colors used.
